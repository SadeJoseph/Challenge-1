# Challenge-1

## Code Refactor Challenge
In this project we were given a starter code for a company website that required improvement. The company wanted a site that follows accessibility standards so that it is optimized for search engines. Furthermore, we were improving our code so that it became a 'little cleaner' than how we found it. 

Firstly, we had to clone the starter code locally and create a GitHub repository for this project. The repository is called Challenge-1 and linked below:

As per the "Aceeptance criteria" I made the following changes to the original starter code. 

- Added a few comments to get a clearer idea of what each section within the css file was for. 

- Included a more descptive title " Horiseon SEO"

- Removed class header within "div" and changed to "header" tag.

- Altered CSS file to compliment the changes made by the removal of class="header". 

- Included an `alt` attribute to all images. 

- Changed first `div` tag to `nav` and altrered css file accordingly.

- Added extra "benefits" class in order to avoid repetition of identical styling properties. Instead of removing the original classes I added an extra class, this was to allow each element to be styled/changed individually if necessary. 

- I also did the same with the classes of the "content" section, adding the class "images" to consolidate the style selectors.

I was able to identify redudent code and how to clean it up whilst gaining famiarlarity with a range of html and css terminology.
